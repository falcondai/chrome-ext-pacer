It nudges you every X minutes via a brief audible tone and an ephemeral desktop notification popup, both optional. 

This tool aids you to achieve higher productivity. I built it for myself and found it useful.

The feature set is minimalist but every feature is well-crafted. The options page is self-explanatory:
* set the time interval of the nudge, from 1 to 60 minutes.
* mute or adjust the volume of a brief audible tone.
* show or hide the desktop notification popup.
* option to enter a motivational quote to show in the notification popup.

Please leave feedback and I will incorporate them in future releases.
