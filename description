It nudges you every X minutes via a brief audible tone, an ephemeral desktop notification popup, and a slim countdown progress bar, all optional and configurable. 

This tool aids you to achieve higher productivity. I built it for myself and found it useful.

The feature set is minimalist but every feature is well-crafted.
* option to enter a motivational quote to show in the desktop notification popup.
* audible tone volume adjustment.
* red/blue color for the countdown progress bar.
* code optimized to minimize its computation resource usage.

Privacy: this extension uses an optional, revocable permission to show the countdown progress bar onto webpages. No data on webpages is accessed. 

This extension is an open source software with source code at https://github.com/falcondai/chrome-ext-pacer

Please leave feedback and I will incorporate them in future releases.
